## Project Overview

The dashboard is built to help HR departments visualize and analyze employee data effectively. It includes:

* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Overall employees, attrition count, attrition rate, active employees, and average age.
* **Detailed Attrition Analysis:** Breakdown of attrition by department, education field, and age group.
* **Employee Demographics:** Visualization of employee count by age group and gender.
* **Job Satisfaction:** A heat map to visualize job satisfaction ratings.   
* **Interactive Slicers:** The dashboard features interactive slicers, including one for education level, allowing users to filter the data and gain specific insights.

# Methodologies
This project followed a standard data analytics workflow:
Data Ingestion: The project began by ingesting the raw data from a Microsoft Excel file (.xlsx) into Power BI.
Data Transformation: While the data was pre-cleaned, further transformations were performed within Power Query to ensure data types were correct and to create any necessary calculated columns or measures.
Visualization & Dashboarding: Visuals, including charts, graphs, and KPI cards, were created and arranged to form a coherent and interactive dashboard.
